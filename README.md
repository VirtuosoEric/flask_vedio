Muted autoplay is always allowed. (YES)
Autoplay with sound is allowed if:
User has interacted with the domain (click, tap, etc.).
On desktop, the user's Media Engagement Index threshold has been crossed, meaning the user has previously played video with sound.
The user has added the site to their home screen on mobile or installed the PWA on desktop. (NOT WOARKING)

Chrome allows you to always enable autoplay by explicitly allowing a website to make sound "Site Settings > Sound"
